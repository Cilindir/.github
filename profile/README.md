Cilindir is a Canadian technology startup operating at the intersection of virtual reality (VR) and artificial 
intelligence (AI). More information about our mission, products, and technology can be found on our
website at [cilindir.ca](https://cilindir.ca/).


## The Cilindir Rift

The Cilindir Rift is a wearables-free communication platform built on VR technology, enabling two or more remote users
to see, hear, and interact as if they are together in the same room. Additionally, the Rift enables natural,
face-to-face communication with conversational AIs, like ChatGPT.


## Developing on the Rift platform

Weâ€™re excited to build a vibrant community of developers and content creators building on the Rift platform. To support
this, weâ€™ll soon open source the documentation, tools, and example projects that enable anyone to build their own 
applications and experiences on the Rift platform. This will make it easier for creators to explore, build, and innovate 
with Rift.

Require our support? Please contact us directly, we'd love to collaborate with you. ðŸš€


## Technologies that interest us

**Real-Time 3D & Game Development:** We're building on [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/), a real-time rendering and game
development platform, and creating digital assets and lifelike animations using tools like [Blender](https://www.blender.org/).

**AI & Machine Learning:** We're working with AI-powered graphics, conversational AI, generative models, and MLOps
technologies for scalable deployment and management of intelligent systems.

**Digital Human Technologies:** We're pioneering realistic digital humans through 3D motion capture and reconstruction,
neural rendering, and AI-driven behavior and speech synthesis.

**Audio-Visual Technologies:** We're designing and building projectors, camera systems, and spatial audio setups to 
deliver immersive products.

If these technologies overlap with your work or interests, feel free to reach out â€“ weâ€™d love to chat!
