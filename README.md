## This is a special repo!

This is a special repository that contains promotional materials, community health files, and organization-wide
templates, such as issue and pull request templates. By centralizing these resources, we reduce redundancy and promote
consistency in how we collaborate, contribute, and maintain our projects.

These defaults can be overridden by adding specific configurations directly to individual repositories.
